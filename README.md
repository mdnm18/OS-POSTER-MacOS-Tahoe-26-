# 🖥️✨ Interactive OS Poster: macOS Tahoe 26

**When a developer designs a poster, it's not just a graphic... It's an experience.**

</div>

This project reimagines the traditional academic poster. Instead of using design software, this poster for our Operating Systems project on **macOS Tahoe 26** was built entirely from scratch using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The goal was to create a presentation that was not only informative but also dynamic and visually engaging, reflecting the modern aesthetics of the OS itself.

The repository contains two distinct versions: a beautifully designed **Static Poster** and a fully **Interactive Poster** with advanced animations and effects.
